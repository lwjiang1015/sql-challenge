## Data Modelling
Using QuickDBD drew a entity relationship diagram (ERD) for all the tables. The image file as well as the queries used to create the image are included in the folder together with this README file.

## Data Engineering

Created tables in the order provided in the starter folder, including:

defining columns with NOT NULL condition where considered necessary
set data type and value length where considered necessary
set primary and foreign keys with references to the related tables

imported the csv file into the tables created for the data analysis below

## Data Analysis

Using queries including "select", "join" and others needed to generate the lists required including:

(1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee
(2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986
(3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name 
(4) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
(5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B 
(6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
(7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
(8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)

The queries for generating the above lists as well as first a few rows of the output can be found in the folder Data Analysis, together with the sql file of the complete queries.
